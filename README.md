# Infinity Game 🎮🕹️🤖

Nothing news, just another infinite game. This time em Python language. 
<br>
Like as Jump Mario -the first infinite game that I'had created -, this game it's also a infinite game. 
<br>
But this time I used just python langague, different that "Jump Mario" that I'had used Java, HTML and CSS.
<br>
Look for "Pula Mario" at my repository and have fun 🎉.
<br>
Welcome and enjoy! 😁

# Obs.: This game there is some bugs yet and isn't concluded, some details are missing. I would like to ask a little patience. I will work to finish 😬🤯
